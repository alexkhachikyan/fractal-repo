# Construction of a gif out of Julia sets. 

## The gif consists of 10 images constructed from 3D matrixes

Each image is constructed using complex polynomial equation of a degree that corresponds to the number of the image in the gif. It is kind of Julia set with c = -0.835 - 0.2321i, but up to 10th degree.
